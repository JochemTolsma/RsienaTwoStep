# 1. GOAL
 
The goal of `RsienaTwoStep` is to provide a method to asses the extent to which results obtained by `RSiena::siena07()` depend on the validity of the **ministep** assumption.

A crucial assumption of the SAOM as implemented in RSiena is the **ministep**: only one actor at the time is allowed to make one tie-change. This package aims to provide a method to asses the extent to which results obtained by RSiena hinge on this crucial ministep assumption. It does so by simulating the evolution of networks by allowing **twosteps** - two actors are allowed to make one tie-change simultaneously - and by allowing **simsteps** - one actor is allowed to make two tie-changes simultaneously.  

## 1.1. Twostep  

Depending on the precise implementation of the twostep procedure, allowing for twosteps can be interpreted simply as:  
- allowing for **simultaneity**: when two actors are picked at random to simultaneously make a ministep;     
- allowing for ***weak* coordination**: two actors are picked at random to simultaneously make a ministep but only specific possible future networks are regarded as the result of coordination and included in the choice set of the two actors;  
- allowing for ***strict* coordination**: only actors are sampled to make a twostep who are connected at time1.  

## 1.2. Simstep  

Allowing for simsteps can be interpreted as:  
- allowing for **simultaneity**: one actor simply can make two ties at the same tie;  
- allowing for **strategic action**: if we see the 'simultaneously' created ties as sequential ties, an actor may create one tie (not necessarily positively evaluated by itself) to ensure that a highly positively evaluated second tie can created next.  

## 1.3. Mixing steps

The package can mix the ratio of ministeps, twosteps and simsteps. 

# 2. Installation

You can install the development version of RsienaTwoStep from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

```r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("JochemTolsma/RsienaTwoStep", build_vignettes=TRUE)
```

## 2.1. Website and Vignettes

Make sure to check out the [package website](https://jochemtolsma.github.io/RsienaTwoStep/) or browse the vignettes: 

```{r, eval=FALSE}
browseVignettes("RsienaTwoStep")
```

# 3. Examples

ABM-ministep, ABM-twostep and ABM-ministep simulations on toy data

```{r example}
library(RsienaTwoStep)
```

## 3.1. Our network

```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, results='hold'}
net1g <- igraph::graph_from_adjacency_matrix(net1, mode="directed")
plot(net1g)
```

## 3.2. setting up cluster 

This is of  course not necessary but will make the simulations a lot faster. 

```{r}
library(doParallel)
#stopCluster(my.cluster) 
n.cores <- parallel::detectCores() - 1  #save one core for other work
# create the cluster
my.cluster <- parallel::makeCluster(n.cores, type = "PSOCK")
# register it to be used by %dopar%
doParallel::registerDoParallel(cl = my.cluster)
```


## 3.3. Degree and reciprocity 

Let us assume people really don't like to have a non-reciprocal tie but do like reciprocal ties a lot. (I only want to help you if you help me!)

Thus if you start with a network without many (reciprocal) ties it would be very difficult to get more reciprocal ties in the normal ministep model. However, with simultaneity this should be possible. 

### 3.3.1. Simulate networks

We can now simulate network given different assumptions with respect to tie-changes. 
Below we simulate according to the traditional ministep assumption, a twostep assumption and a simstep assumption.  

```{r}
sims1 <- ts_sims(nsims=1000, parallel=TRUE, net=net1, rate=10, statistics=list(ts_degree, ts_recip), parameters=c(-1,2), p2step=c(1,0,0), chain=FALSE) #ministep only (one actor can make one tie change)

sims2 <- ts_sims(nsims=1000, parallel=TRUE, net=net1, rate=10, statistics=list(ts_degree, ts_recip), parameters=c(-1,2), p2step=c(0,1,0), chain=FALSE) #twostep-simultaneity (two random actors can make one tie change simultaneously)

sims3 <- ts_sims(nsims=1000, parallel=TRUE, net=net1, rate=10, statistics=list(ts_degree, ts_recip), parameters=c(-1,2), p2step=c(0,0,1), chain=FALSE) #simstep (one actor can make two tie changes simultaneously)
```

### 3.3.2. Network census 

The package `RsienaTwoStep` has build in functions for a dyad census and a triad census. Let us compare the dyad census of our simulated networks.  

```{r}
df_s1 <- ts_dyads(sims=sims1, simtype="ministep") 
df_s2 <- ts_dyads(sims=sims2, simtype="twostep-simultaneity") 
df_s3 <- ts_dyads(sims=sims3, simtype="simstep") 
```

### 3.3.3. Plot dyadcensus 

```{r, warning=FALSE}
library(ggplot2)

# combine datasets
df <- rbind(df_s1, df_s2, df_s3)

p <- ggplot(df, aes(x=x, y=y, fill=factor(type, levels=c("ministep", "twostep-simultaneity", "simstep")))) + 
  geom_violin(position=position_dodge(.8)) + 
  stat_summary(fun = mean,
               geom = "errorbar",
               fun.max = function(x) mean(x) + sd(x),
               fun.min = function(x) mean(x) - sd(x),
               width=.1,
               color="red", position=position_dodge(.8)) + 
  stat_summary(fun = mean,
               geom = "point",
               color="red", position=position_dodge(.8)) +
  labs(x = "dyad type", y = "dyad count", fill="simulation type")
  
p
```

# 4. Conclusion

1. If two actors are allowed to change their ties simultaneously, this will lead to more reciprocal ties than when actors have to make a tie-change one after each other. The final network is thus also more dense if we assume a twostep process compared to a ministep process.  
2. For this network and given only degree and reciprocity as relevant network statistics, the ministep and simstep model lead to similar results.  


<!--- 

What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`? You can include R chunks like so:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

You'll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md` up-to-date. `devtools::build_readme()` is handy for this. You could also use GitHub Actions to re-render `README.Rmd` every time you push. An example workflow can be found here: <https://github.com/r-lib/actions/tree/v1/examples>.

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo = FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

In that case, don't forget to commit and push the resulting figure files, so they display on GitHub and CRAN.
