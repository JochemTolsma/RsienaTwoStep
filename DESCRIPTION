Description: A crucial assumption of the SAOM as implemented in RSiena is
    the 'ministep': only one actor at the time is allowed to make one
    tie-change. This package aims to provide a method to asses the extent
    to which results obtained by RSiena hinge on this crucial ministep
    assumption. It does so by simulating the evoluation of networks by
    allowing two actors to make decisions on tie-changes simultaneously.
    Depending on the precise implementation of the two-step procedure,
    allowing for twosteps can be interpreted simply as allowing for
    simultaneity (when two actors are picked at random to simultaneously
    make a ministep), or as coordination (when there are either rules on
    which two actors are allowed to make a twostep and/or which options
    after the twostep count as coordination and are included in the choice
    set of the two actors). The package can mix the ratio of ministeps and
    twosteps.
